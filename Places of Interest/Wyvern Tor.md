## Description
- We don't know anything about this place
## Location
- About a day and a half NEE of [[Phandalin]]
- Just south of [[Old Owl Well]]
## Story Points
- There's apparently an "orc menace" here, if we deal with it there's a 600gp reward
## Notes
- Since it's close to [[Old Owl Well]], it might be a good idea to knock out both of those side quests at once if we're in the area
