## Description

## Location
- Underneath [[Tresendar Manor]], just east of [[Phandalin]]
## Story Points
- This is where the [[Redbrands]] are hiding out while they menace [[Phandalin]]
- Two entrances that we know of, the kitchen of the manor and a secret tunnel entrance in the cliffs south of the manor
- Entered via the secret tunnel and found a ravine with apparently naturally-occuring necromantic energy, acting as a sort of persevative to the bodies at the bottom
- We were attacked by a [[Nothic]], who seems to have been drawn to the magical energy of the ravine, and who apparently had a loose alliance with [[Glasstaff]]
	- We were also attacked by a single [[Bugbear]], which [[Braelynn Gaslight]] absolutely murdered
- Found a chest with some nice loot in the ravine
- Found a hidden door in the southwest corner of the cavern, leading to a room with a door to a storage/rest room, stairs to the kitchen, and a door to the [[Tresendar Crypt]], which has the prison cells either in it or on the other side
## Notes
- [[Glasstaff]]'s room is in the NE corner of the area, back across the ravine
- The other rooms on that side are where some more men, goblins, etc. sleep and/or hang out
- The stairs in the room through the secret door lead up to the kitchen of [[Tresendar Manor]]
- The door by the stairs goes into [[Tresendar Crypt]], and on the other side of that is where the [[Redbrands]] keep their prisoners before selling them
