## Session Notes
- Wake up the next day
- Gundren wants to come with us to Wave Echo Cave, but he needs time to recover. Plus the Black Spider will have had a setback now that we have Iarno's research and tools
- First headed to the Miner's Exchange to sell some loot
	- Halia also mentioned that SIldar was trying to raise a sort of more official town guard, but she seemed weirdly not super OK about it
	- However we rolled shit insight and couldn't get further details
- Proceeded to the Lionshield Coster
	- Ordered splint armor for Braelynn and Dick, paid half upfront and will pick it up and pay the other half from the smithy in 3 days
- On the first day, Firby saw what looked like a large bird of prey circling to the south. But as he looked more closely, it looked further and further away, and was thus much larger
- Spent our first night on the trail without incident
- Turned off the road and headed south a bit into the next day, and eventually entered a more forested, hilly region
- Came across a long-dead stag, partially eroded by acid. As we investigated it, two large insect-like creatures burst from the ground around us.
- It was a tough fight, but we managed to kill the two Ankhegs
	- They can grapple with their attack, resulting in powerful up-close acid breath attacks
	- They can also shoot a line of acid
	- The babies cannibalize their monther after being born
	- Hitting them with a strong enough fire attack recharges the acid breath early
- The rest of the afternoon passed without incident, and we settled in for an evening rest
- Finally arrive at Wyvern Tor. We see three orcs on guard, who have a more martial aspect to them
