## Session Notes
- We went back to bed, keeping an eye on our prisoner and the two bodies
	- On the body of the dead assassin, we find a small vial that looks like the vial the other assassin tried to kill theirself with
	- On the doppelganger, we find a small, palm-sized stone that has some sort of magical aura
- He says the doppelganger's name is Virith
- He's surprised that the orcs are still around, given our presence here.
