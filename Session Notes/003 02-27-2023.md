## Session Notes
- Met back up with [[Quelline Alderleaf]] and [[Carp Alderleaf]]
- They led us to the tunnel, seemingly without incident
- [[Quelline Alderleaf]] and [[Carp Alderleaf]] head home, and we enter the tunnel with [[Piuma Stunt]]'s familiar Sylvester scouting ahead
- We come to a ravine and hear a mysterious voice in our head
- Killed a mysterious 1-eyed beast and a [[Bugbear]]
- Found a chest in the ravine with some loot
- Found some fresher bodies in the ravine
	- The necromantic energy in the ravine seems to be preserving the body
	- Flip over the second body, and it's the long-dead corpse of [[Harbin Wester]] (!!!), who appears to have been dead for several weeks at least
- Firby examines the 1-eyed beast, it's a [[Nothic]], and it's definitely dead
- One of the items in the chest is a +1 longsword
	- The sword belonged to a knight named [[Aldith Tresendar]]
- Through a secret door, we find the stairs, presumably to the kitchen, a door to the rest of the hideout, and a door to a room with 3 [[Redbrands]]. Killed 2, spared 1 to interrogate
	- Doesn't know much about [[Glasstaff]], his HQ is in the northwest of the [[Redbrand Hideout]]
	- [[Mirna Drendar]] and her children are being held to sell off
	- Says the [[Bugbear]]s and [[Goblin]]s were recently sent by the [[Black Spider]] to "help", which is all he knows
	- [[Tresendar Crypt]] is through that other door, leads to a makeshift cell where they keep prisoners
	- And there are a couple more rooms on the other side of the ravine where other men sleep/stay
	- Says there are usually about 10 men, there are a few bugbears, and a goblin
	- There are usually a few guarding the prisoners, then more on the west side
	- We tied him up and gagged him, and stacked a bunch of heavy shit on the other side of the door. We plan to come back and get him after everything else, and turn him in in town.
