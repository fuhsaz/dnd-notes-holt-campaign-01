- Need to ask around to see if anyone has a better idea of where [[Kragmaw Castle]] is.
	- [[Linene Graywind]] might have an idea, because she deals in arms
	- [[Halia Thornton]] might have an idea, based on [[Daran Edermath]] referring us to her after we asked about hunting down the [[Redbrands]]
- Possibly ask around after [[Iarno Albreck]]
- It might be several days before the other two [[Rockseeker Brothers]] return, might give us some time to explore another thread while we wait
	- Ousting the [[Redbrands]]
		- Who was [[Thel Drendar]] and why did they kill him? Where is his family?
	- Trouble at [[Old Owl Well]] - might take too long for now, it's about 2 days from [[Phandalin]]
