## Todo
- Interrogate [[Glasstaff]]
	- How did he get started working with the [[Black Spider]], [[Redbrands]], and goblins, and why?
	- Who is the [[Black Spider]]?
	- Why do they want to find [[Wave Echo Cave]]?
	- Was he the person disguised as [[Harbin Wester]]?
- Loot the dungeon
- Find the keys or otherwise break out [[Mirna Drendar]] and her kids
- Take [[Glasstaff]] and the two captive [[Redbrands]] into town
	- Make sure he cannot perform any parts of a spell while we're escorting him. Hands thoroughly tied up, gagged if he's not being questioned, etc.
	- We could spread out while questioning him so that he can't teleport out of our range again.
	- Blindfolding him might also work, although that might require [[Piuma Stunt]] to know that Misty Step requires you to be able to see where you're teleporting
	- [[Piuma Stunt]] *recognized Misty Step* when [[Glasstaff]] cast it, so he should hopefully know its limitations, i.e. if he can't see or if he can't talk, he can't use it.
- The contents of the armory may be worth a bit, we should tell [[Linene Graywind]] about it
