- Find the keys or otherwise break out [[Mirna Drendar]] and her kids
- Take [[Glasstaff]] and the two captive [[Redbrands]] into town
	- Make sure he cannot perform any parts of a spell while we're escorting him. Hands thoroughly tied up, gagged if he's not being questioned, etc.
	- We could spread out while questioning him so that he can't teleport out of our range again.
	- Blindfolding him might also work, although that might require [[Piuma Stunt]] to know that Misty Step requires you to be able to see where you're teleporting
- The contents of the armory may be worth a bit, we should tell [[Linene Graywind]] about it
