## Session Notes
- Proceeded into the crypt, were attacked by 3 [[Skeleton]]s when we tried to open the sarcophagi there
	- Killed them and 2 [[Redbrands]] who came in as well
	- Found a platinum ring in one of the coffins
- Found [[Mirna Drendar]] and her children in some cells, but no keys. We'll come back for them after dealing with the rest of the gang
- Found a room with 2 [[Bugbear]]s and 4 drunk [[Redbrands]]
	- We killed them, but a rat ran out of the room into the adjacent one, and turned out to be [[Glasstaff]]s familiar. 
- [[Glasstaff]], based on the descriptions we were given, does indeed seem to be [[Iarno Albreck]]
- A chase ensued and we finally caught up to him and restrained/sleeped him
