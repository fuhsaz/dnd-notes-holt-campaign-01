## Session Notes
- We return to our heroes finding themselves in somewhat of a pinch, surrounded by like 7 goblins
	- One beefier one had a whip that forced a wis save, so we kept that
- We whomped them, and saved one to interrogate
- Drow worship a spider queen goddess Lolth, so the spiders are working with the Black Spider
- We also found some shiny metal gauntlets
- We followed the last goblins instructions to find a room with 3 bugbears guarding Nundro, Gundren's brother.
- We almost were able to save him, but ended up in a fight with the bugbears and some spiders, in which one of the bugbears killed Nundro. We slaughtered them all and used our revivify scroll to restore Nundro.
- We sent the orcs to escort Nundro back to Gundren
- We went back and, with Guidance from Firby, Dick snuck up on the Flame Skull, which had revived, and murdered it. It had not yet restored it's Fireball...
