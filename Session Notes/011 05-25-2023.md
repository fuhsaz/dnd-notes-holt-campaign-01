## Session Notes
- We are going to attempt to negotiate with the orcs
- We walked up and told them we wanted to negotiate, and asked if we could talk to their leader
	- Firby read their thoughts, they were kinda confused about the whole situation
	- We passed a big two-headed dude, an Ettin, who looked dangerous
	- They bring us to their leader, Brughor Axe-Biter
- We told him about the Forge of Spells being rediscovered, and the threat the black spider would pose if he were to get it.
- He asked if we could do something for them to prove our good faith
	- We need to go to Old Owl Well, and recover a bracelet from one of their orcs who fell to the undead there, an orc woman named Nella
- We shared din with the orcs, then went on our way. We found a campsite and settled down for the night
- In the night though, 3 people trigged our alarm: 2 drow and an orc
- We fought them, and the orc ran away once Firby's spike growth dropped.
- Piuma and Dick chased down the orc, watching a sleep spell apparently fail to affect the creature.
- In a last-ditch effort, Dick chucked his last javelin after a full dash and barely managed to slay the orc, which turned out to be a Doppelganger!
	- Was it Vhalak? Who knows.
- We also captured one of the Drow, Braelynn was able to Lay On Hands it to prevent an attempted suicide by poison.
