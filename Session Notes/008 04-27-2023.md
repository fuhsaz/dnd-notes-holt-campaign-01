## Todo
- Interrogate [[King Grol]] and the Drow we incapacitated
- Check that door to see if [[Gundren Rockseeker]] is imprisoned inside
- Check out the [[Goblin]]s' food room
- Loot the castle!
## Open quests, side-quests, errands
- Trouble at [[Old Owl Well]]
- Orc Menace at [[Wyvern Tor]]
	- 600 gp
	- It turns out that, while this threat is real, the reward may not be. [[Vhalak]] was told to divert potentially nosy adventurers here to get them out of the way, and to potentially nip in the bud a possible problem for the [[Black Spider]]'s excavation of [[Wave Echo Cave]]
- Rescue [[Gundren Rockseeker]]
	- 500 gp
	- I think this reward will come from [[Sildar Hallwinter]]?
