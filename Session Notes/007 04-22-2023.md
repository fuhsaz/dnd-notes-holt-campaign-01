## Session Notes
- Killed the [[Grick]]
	- Resistant to non-magical damage
- Found ourselves in a sort of chapel
- Search in a brazier
	- Find a gold statuette of a sun-elf, worth 100gp
		- Gives off a magical aura - divination
- Found a room guarded by two more official-looking [[Hobgoblin]]s. [[Firby Mountainhome]] did some recon as a rat.
	- Heard two voices inside, a deeper goblin-esque voice and a smooth female voice. Also he heard a bear
- [[Firby Mountainhome]] disguised himself as a [[Goblin]] to lure out one of the guards, who we assassinated, then we slept the other guard. 
- We fought a drow woman, [[King Grol]], king of the [[Hobgoblin]]s who seemed to be buffing his allies, and a [[Bear]].  [[King Grol]] was wielding a fancy-looking glaive.
- 3 [[Goblin]]s were attracted by the sound of the fight, but ran away. We chased them down and killed two of them.
