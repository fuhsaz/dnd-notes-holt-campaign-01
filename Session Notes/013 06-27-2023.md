## Session Notes
- We left the Red Wizard's campsite and headed back to the orcs' cave
- Went back to the orcs, told them what had happened. Arranged to meet with them outside of Wave Echo Cave.
	- Also told them about Kragmaw Castle, in case they might like to move in
- We made it back to Phandalin without incident
- Met up with Sildar, who agreed to come with us, along with Gundren
- Bought some supplies, and Darren Edermath gave us a superior healing potion as thanks for clearing out Old Owl Well
- We arrived at the meeting place to find Brughor at the meeting place, with two of his warriors, Sark and Brokka
	- They had already taken care of some sentries
- Inside the cave, we found an old campsite with the body of Gundren's brother Tharden
- We decided to leave Gundren, Sildar, Boris (Brughor's boar), and Brokka at the entrance to the cavern
	- We consulted the augury statue about heading left (vs right) in terms of looking for Gundren's remaining brother, Nundro, and got a good feeling
- We ran into an ooze, an Ochre Jelly
	- Hitting it with slashing weapons makes it divide
- Continued on to a cavern with a big pool of water.
	- Raccoon Firby went swimming and found a skeleton with some treasure
	- 2 platinum rings and some sort of wand!
