## Todo
- Need to ask around to see if anyone has a better idea of where [[Kragmaw Castle]] is.
	- [[Halia Thornton]] might have an idea, based on [[Daran Edermath]] referring us to her after we asked about hunting down the [[Redbrands]]
- Possibly ask around after [[Iarno Albreck]]
- It might be several days before the other two [[Rockseeker Brothers]] return, might give us some time to explore another thread while we wait
	- Ousting the [[Redbrands]]
		- Who was [[Thel Drendar]] and why did they kill him? Where is his family?
	- Trouble at [[Old Owl Well]] - might take too long for now, it's about 2 days from [[Phandalin]]

## Session
- Wake up at the inn after an uninterrupted long rest
- [[Sildar Hallwinter]] is going to look around for [[Iarno Albreck]], and we're supposed to meet up with him at the [[Townmaster's Hall]]
- Asked [[Toblin Stonehill]] about the ruined house up on the hill (Tresendar Manor)
	- Doesn't know who used to live there
	- [[Redbrands]] have been seen coming and going from there
- Pass a wanted poster on a message board outside the town hall
	- "Those of a mind to face the orc menace"
	- Orcs near [[Wyvern Tor]] - 600gp
	- None of us know where that is, also the building is locked
- Enter the [[Phandalin Miners' Exchange]], see a tough-looking, no-nonsense sort of woman who we assume is [[Halia Thornton]]
	- She'll give us 160 gold if we deal with their leader, [[Glasstaff]], and drive them out of town
	- Says they have a hideout underneath [[Tresendar Manor]]
		- Mentions [[Quelline Alderleaf]]'s boy [[Carp Alderleaf]] may have seen some [[Redbrands]] out in some woods
	- Asked here where [[Wyvern Tor]] is
		- It's like a day and a half away, a bit south of [[Old Owl Well]]
	- Asked here where [[Kragmaw Castle]] is
		- Doesn't know, but she has heard that [[Redbrands]] have been seen in the company of goblins
	- Asked about [[Iarno Albreck]] 
		- Doesn't know about him
	- Asked about [[Thel Drendar]] 
		- Was a woodcarver in town
		- Had a confrontation with the [[Redbrands]] after they harrassed him and his family at his shop a few days ago
- Went to the [[Woodworker]] shop on the way to the farm
	- Could see signs of a struggle in both the shop and the living quarters
	- So it looks like the wife and children didn't necessarily leave on their own
Got to here while going over notes
- Start walking towards the [[Alderleaf Farm]] 
	- Carp tells us that he was out playing in the woods a few days ago, saw "The Bad Men" show up and appear basically out of nowhere. He thinks they have a secret tunnel
	- Said to come back in the evening and they'd show us where
- Head back to the [[Townmaster's Hall]]
	- Find [[Sildar Hallwinter]] and [[Harbin Wester]] there
	- [[Sildar Hallwinter]] wants to walk and talk (possibly not talking in front of [[Harbin Wester]]?)
	- Pays us our 40gp
	- Asks for us to investigate [[Iarno Albreck]]'s disappearance, says he'll pay us 200gp if we can find or solve that
	- Asked about the [[Rockseeker Brothers]], hasn't had an update on them
	- Asked about [[Kragmaw Castle]]
		- If we were to search in the [[Neverwinter Wood]], we'd likely find a group of goblins who could lead us
- Head back to the [[Townmaster's Hall]] and drop [[Sildar Hallwinter]] off
- Head to the [[Sleeping Giant Inn]]
	- Aaaaand we get jumped by 4 [[Redbrands]]
	- Killed 3, grabbed one for interrogation
- Interrogated the last guy, [[Lance]]
	- [[Thel Drendar]]'s family is being held in their hideout
	- They do have a hideout under the manor, can be reached under the kitchen
	- He's heard there is a tunnel entrance in the cliffs/forest to the south
	- Hasn't met [[Glasstaff]]
	- Thinks there are about 10-12 people in the base at a time
	- Said that the [[Redbrands]] _had been aware of us_ and that his group was dispatched to deal with us.
- IS [[Iarno Albreck]] GLASSTAFF??
	- [[Sildar Hallwinter]] doesn't recognize anything about a glass staff
