## Todo
- Give Sildar his armor back
- Bring Gundren back to Sildar for the rewards
## Open quests, side-quests, errands
- Trouble at [[Old Owl Well]]
- Orc Menace at [[Wyvern Tor]]
	- 600 gp
	- It turns out that, while this threat is real, the reward may not be. [[Vhalak]] was told to divert potentially nosy adventurers here to get them out of the way, and to potentially nip in the bud a possible problem for the [[Black Spider]]'s excavation of [[Wave Echo Cave]]
## Session Notes
- We started traveling south, but after an hour or two of traveling, Firby noticed we were being followed
- It was a Displacer Beast, and we engaged it
	- We have disadvantage when attacking it, which wears off if we hit them, until the end of their turn
	- They can also do a tentacle attack, which grapples, then they can carry you off
	- We whooped em
	- Tried to skin them, _barely_ failed, good bye Cloak of Displacement
- Braelynn prayed to Tymora at the Shrine of Luck, as she was feeling pretty down on herself after some bad rolls. She got an inspiration!
- Got back to Phandalin, reunited Gundren and Sildar
- Sildar asked us to go deal with those orcs from the bounty poster.
- We returned to the tavern for the night
	- We decided to have Firby read SIldar and Gundrens' minds with his new Telepathic feat, to see if we could suss out the Doppelganger
	- Taught Toblerone how to make bakes apples, so we could get some dessert
- Long rest!
