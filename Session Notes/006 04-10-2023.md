	- See if we can find any clues to the location of [[Wave Echo Cave]]

## Open quests, side-quests, errands
- Trouble at [[Old Owl Well]]

	- It turns out that, while this threat is real, the reward may not be. [[Vhalak]] was told to divert potentially nosy adventurers here to get them out of the way, and to potentially nip in the bud a possible problem for the [[Black Spider]]'s excavation of [[Wave Echo Cave]]
- Rescue [[Gundren Rockseeker]]
	- 500 gp
## Session Notes
- We picked up standing in front of [[Cragmaw Castle]].
- [[Firby Mountainhome]], in possum form, scouted the castle, then we went in the front door. 
- We split the group and went into two doors, thinking we'd get a pincer movement on the enemies inside
- Instead, we ran into two separate rooms. [[Dick Johnson]] and [[Firby Mountainhome]] found a room with 4 [[Hobgoblin]]s, and [[Braelynn Gaslight]] and [[Piuma Stunt]] found a room with 2 [[Goblin]]s. 
- We killed them,  as well as 2 [[Goblin]]s that came from the south to investigate. 
- We killed 2 more [[Goblin]]s, one a priest of [[Maglubiyet]](?). 
- We found some ritual materials on the altar of this new chapel room, then a big worm thing fell on [[Dick Johnson]]'s head, surprising everyone but [[Firby Mountainhome]].
