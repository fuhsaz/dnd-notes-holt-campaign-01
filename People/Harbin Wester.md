## Description
- Current Town Master of [[Phandalin]]
- Not very good at governing and helping the people, but good with finances
## Location
**Past:** 
**Current:** [[Phandalin]]
## Story Points
- Apparently has done nothing since the [[Redbrands]] killed [[Thel Drendar]] and seemingly abducted his wife [[Mirna Drendar]] and their children
- Several citizens have said that he is so passive with regards to the [[Redbrands]] that if they didn't know him better, they'd think he was in league with them
	- Possible blackmail?
	- He's too by-the-books to accept bribes, they said
- IS NOT THE REAL HARBIN WESTER
	- We found weeks-dead body of [[Harbin Wester]] at the bottom of a ravine in the [[Redbrand Hideout]]
