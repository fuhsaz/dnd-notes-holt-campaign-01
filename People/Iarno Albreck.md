- Found a letter from the [[Black Spider]], who he does indeed have a partnership with:
	Lord Albrek, 
	My spies in Neverwinter tell me that strangers are due to arrive in Phandalin. They could be working for the dwarves. Capture them if you can, kill them if you must, but don't allow them to upset our plans. See that any dwarves maps in their possession are delivered to me with haste. I'm counting on you Iarno. Don't disappoint me. 
	Spider
