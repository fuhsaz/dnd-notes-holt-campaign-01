## Description
- Human, member of the [[Redbrands]]
## Location
**Current:** [[Phandalin]]
## Story Points
- We left him alive to interrogate him after he and his 3 companions jumped us to try to get us out of town
- Confirmed [[Mirna Drendar]] and her kids are being held in their hideout
- They do have a hideout under [[Tresendar Manor]], which can be reached via the kitchen or a secret tunnel in the cliffs to the south
- Hasn't personally seen or met [[Glasstaff]]
- Expects that there are about 10-12 [[Redbrands]] in the hideout at a time
- Said that the [[Redbrands]] were already aware of us, and they were looking for us when we ran across them, it wasn't a coincidence
