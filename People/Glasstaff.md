## Description
- No one we've talked to knows much about him, except that he uses a glass staff, hence, the name
- Is likely a spellcaster of some sort
## Location
**Current:** [[Redbrands]] hideout in [[Phandalin]]
## Story Points
- The [[Redbrands]] member we interrogated said that he doesn't often come out, and that he hadn't personally seen him
- The fact that he's a (probable) human, and uses a staff, makes us wonder if he's possibly connected to [[Iarno Albreck]].
- We found him in the [[Redbrand Hideout]], he does seem to be [[Iarno Albreck]]. We chased, caught, and restrained him just before he drank a potion of invisibility to escape
