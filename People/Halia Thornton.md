## Description
- Owner of [[Phandalin Miners' Exchange]]
## Location
**Current:** [[Phandalin]]
## Story Points
- Might be able to give us patronage/reward/assistance with driving out the [[Redbrands]]
- Will pay us 160gp if we deal with the [[Redbrands]]. Get rid of their leader [[Glasstaff]] and drive them out of town
- Knew where [[Wyvern Tor]] was, didn't know about [[Kragmaw Castle]] _but_ said that the [[Redbrands]] have been seen in the company of [[Goblin]]s, so they may be a possible lead on that front as well
